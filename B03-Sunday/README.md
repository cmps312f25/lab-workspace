# Lab Practice

This folder is for all **Lab Practice work**.  

## Submission Instructions
- Copy the **weekly lab folder** you worked on.  
- Move it into this directory under a proper name.  
  - Example: `Lab1/`, `Lab2/`, `Lab3/` …  
- Continue working **inside the copied folder** to complete your lab tasks.  

## Notes
- Keep the folder structure organized.  
- Do **not** overwrite previous labs — each lab should have its own folder.
